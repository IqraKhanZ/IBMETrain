# 🌍 Geo-Sentiment Mapping of Public Events

This project focuses on analyzing **tweets** and **news headlines** to visualize **sentiment** and **emotion trends** across different geographic regions using **geospatial data** and **machine learning**.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand dataset structure and distributions.
- Generate **interactive visualizations** (e.g., maps, word clouds, sentiment trends).
- Train **ML models** to classify sentiment and emotion using features like text, time, and location.
- Evaluate model performance with metrics such as **Accuracy**, **F1-Score**, and **Confusion Matrices**.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes 10,000+ records of public events with:

- 📝 **Text Content & Sentiment**: Raw text, sentiment labels (Positive, Negative, Neutral), VADER scores.
- 📍 **Geospatial Info**: Latitude, longitude, and location columns.
- ⏰ **Temporal Features**: Extracted date/time components.
- 🗞️ **Source & Emotion Labels**: Origin (Twitter/News) and emotion tags (Anger, Anticipation, etc.).

## 📈 Key Insights

- Majority of data leans toward **positive sentiment (~60%)**.
- **Anger**, **Anticipation**, and **Surprise** are dominant emotions.
- Cities like **New York**, **Cairo**, and **Tokyo** emerge as sentiment hotspots.
- Sentiment activity declines over time, especially **positive sentiment**.
- Strong correlation (0.84) between VADER scores and sentiment encoding.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning

- Supervised models trained on encoded features to classify **sentiment** and **emotion**.
- Evaluated using standard classification metrics.
- Models provide predictive insights for real-time event classification.

---

## 🌐 Visualizations

- **Geo Bubble Maps** using Plotly & Folium.
- **Word Clouds** for key topics and event categories.
- **Time series plots** for sentiment/emotion trends.
- **Bar plots & heatmaps** for categorical and correlation analysis.

---

## 🔮 Future Work

- Add more diverse sources (forums, websites).
- Enhance models with advanced NLP (e.g., sarcasm detection).
- Increase geospatial granularity to neighborhood level.
- Deploy **real-time dashboards** for live sentiment tracking.
